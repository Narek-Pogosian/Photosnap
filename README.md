# Photosnap

This is my solution to a Frontend Mentor challenge, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/photosnap-multipage-website-nMDSrNmNW">Link here</a>

## How it was built

This project was built with Astro for easier routing and to take advantage of components, the styling is written mobile first with SCSS.

## Note! 
The contact page is not included in the original design but i created my own anyway.
All the "stories" are written in markdown which with the help of astros static site generation also have their own page, but these pages are not part of the
original design and thats why the dont have real content and look boring.
